This is Tigger.  
      
Note because this is an early alpha there is no installer which means
you have to do it by hand as explained below:

Installation:
Make sure ruby is installed .
$ gem install grit
Copy tigger executable into your /usr/bin folder.
You're ready to roar.

Usage:
*navigate to a project directory that uses Git*
tigger init //this initializes relevant tigger files

tigger new "Complete this task"

tigger tasks //will print out all the current tasks

git commit -am "Complete this task" //Tigger will automagically know that you have completed a task
