This is Tigger.  
      
Note because this is an early alpha there is no installer which means
you have to do it by hand as explained below:

Installation:
Navigate to the directory you downloaded tigger to.
Type "make"
You're ready to roar.

Usage: (In a project dir that uses Git)
tigger init //this initializes relevant tigger files

tigger new "Complete this task"

tigger tasks //will print out all the current tasks

git commit -am "Complete this task" //Tigger will automagically know that you have completed a task
